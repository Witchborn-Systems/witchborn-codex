# Governance

The Witchborn Codex is stewarded by **Witchborn Systems**, a Texas-based
501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

## Stewardship Model

Witchborn Systems acts as a steward, not an owner.

The Codex exists to provide a neutral identity and resolution layer for
autonomous systems in the public interest.

## Authority & Trust

- The Codex has a single canonical root authority.
- Root data may be mirrored freely.
- Authenticity is established by cryptographic signature, not server location.

## Protective Holds

Certain high-risk or high-value identifiers are reserved to prevent
phishing, impersonation, and public harm.

Reserved identifiers resolve to a Safe Harbor page.

Verified trademark holders may claim their identifiers at zero cost
via legacy DNS TXT verification.

## Revocation

Identifiers used for malicious purposes (e.g. phishing, malware
distribution) may be revoked.

All revocations are logged and include a stated cause.
Appeals are permitted.

## Non-Affiliation

Witchborn Systems is not affiliated with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic,
or any other trademark holder.
